# ShishMaJung
An Europa Universalis IV mod

IMPORTANT

to make the mod work you need to do the following:

1. you need to put the contents of "ShishMaJung" in to the folder "ShishMaJung" under documents/paradox interactive/europa universalis IV/mod/ShishMaJung
2. you need to copy the descriptor.mod to the "europa universalis IV/mod/" directory and rename it to "ShishMaJung"
3. After copying the file you need to add a path betwen remote_file_id and supported_version. This path="c:/.../ShishMaJung" needs forward slashes instead of backward slashes and has to be the full path to the mod/ShishMaJung directory
